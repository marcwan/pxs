PixieScript (pxs)

This is my first attempt to write a Virtual Machine for a new programming
language that looks an awful lot like JavaScript, but cleaned up a little
bit and with proper classes.

This is kind of a personal experiment:

I've never implemented a VM before, so please don't cringe too hard when you
see this. I decided to do this all from scratch and not do any reading on 
common "VM implementation strategies" -- I want to do this all the hard way
and make all the mistakes possible.
